The goal of templater is to provide a standard R project structure with reasonable defaults.

To make use of it, clone the repository to your local computer and then follow the instructions in `DELETE-AFTER-DOING.md`

Please let us know where the instructions let you down, or where you think the (deliberately simple) defaults could be better or should be made simpler. To do so, file an issue at `www.github.com/SATVILab/templater`. Thanks!
