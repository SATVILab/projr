\arguments{
\item{path}{character vector.
Path(s) to hooks, relative to project root (if not absolute).}

\item{title}{character.
Title for set of hooks.
Initial and trailing spaces are removed, and
the middle spaces are converted to dashes.
For example, \code{" a b "} is converted to
\code{"a-b"}. `}

\item{stage}{"pre" or "post".
Whether to run the hook before or after the build.}

\item{cue}{"build", "dev", "patch", "minor" or "major".
Which minimum build level triggers the hooks.
"build" and "dev" are equivalent, and
always trigger the scripts.}

\item{overwrite}{logical.
Whether to overwrite any hook settings
of the same title in the \code{projr}
configuration file.
If \code{FALSE} and there already exists
a key under \code{build/hooks} with the name
\code{title}, an error is thrown.
Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{profile}{character.
Profile to add the hook to.
If \verb{"default"`` (the default), the hook is added to the default profile, which is }_projr.yml`.}
}
\description{
Convenience functions to add or remove hooks
to run before or after the build.
\itemize{
\item .yml_hooks_add`: Add a script to run before or after the build.
\item .yml_hooks_rm`: Remove scripts to run.
}

.yml_hooks_add_pre\verb{ and .yml_hooks_add_post}
are wrappers around .yml_hooks_add\verb{that set the}stage\verb{argument to}"pre"\code{or}"post"\verb{, respectively. .yml_hooks_rm_all} removes all scripts.
}
\details{
Within a stage (pre- or post-build), hooks
are run in the order set in \verb{_projr.yml}.
They are not run in the same environment as the
build process.
The pre-build scripts are run immediately after
bumping the project version (if that is done) and immediately
before committing the present state of the code to Git.
The post-build scripts are run immediately after
committing the present state of the code to Git,
and before distributing project artefacts to the remotes.
