\usage{
projr_yml_restrictions_set(
  branch = NULL,
  not_behind = NULL,
  profile = "default"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{branch}{logical or character.
Controls which branches can perform builds.
If \code{TRUE}, builds allowed on any branch (default).
If a character vector, builds only allowed on these branches.
If \code{FALSE}, builds restricted on all branches.
If \code{NULL}, setting is not changed.
Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{not_behind}{logical.
Controls whether to check if branch is behind remote upstream.
If \code{TRUE} (default), build fails if branch is behind.
If \code{FALSE}, no check is performed.
If \code{NULL}, setting is not changed.
Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{profile}{character.
The profile to write to.
Default is "default", in which case it writes to \verb{_projr.yml}.}
}
\description{
\code{projr_yml_restrictions_set} sets build restrictions in \verb{_projr.yml}.

The options are:
\itemize{
\item branch: controls which branches can perform builds.
If \code{TRUE} (default), builds are allowed on any branch.
If a character vector, builds are only allowed on matching branches.
If \code{FALSE}, builds are restricted (treated as empty character vector).
\item not_behind: whether to check if branch is behind remote upstream.
If \code{TRUE} (default), build fails if branch is behind remote.
If \code{FALSE}, no check is performed.
}

\dontrun{
# Allow builds on any branch (default)

# Allow builds only on main and dev branches

# Restrict builds on all branches
projr_yml_restrictions_set(branch = FALSE)

# Disable check for being behind remote

# Enable check for being behind remote (default)
