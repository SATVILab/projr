- During dev builds:
  - Both any output and docs are kept in `projr/<label>/<version>` sub-directories of a cache directory. If a cache directory has label `cache` exactly (after forcing it to lower case), then that directory is used. Otherwise, the first cache directory specified in `_projr.yml` is used.
